What does it do?
================

The extension enables you to do a radial search for locations and display them in a list and a responsive Google map with Google infoWindows. The driving
route to a location can be shown in Google maps too. The extension is based on multiple plugins. This way you can use more than one 
plugin of the extension on the same page. There are two searchforms, one with Google's autocompleter.
A single view of the location is implemented too, this can be used to display just a Google map without doing a search when the locationUid is given
in the constant editor of TYPO3. Google's streetview, traffic layer and bicycling layer can be activated too in the constant editor.

What's new?
^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 9.x compatibility dropped. Signals removed and events PSR-14 implemented. Gesture handling implemented.
